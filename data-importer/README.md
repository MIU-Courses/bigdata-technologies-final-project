# CSV Data to Kafka Topic Pipeline

## Overview:
This pipeline demonstrates a process for ingesting data from CSV files into a Kafka topic. It utilizes Kafka Connect, a tool that comes bundled with Apache Kafka, to stream data from CSV files into Kafka topics. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the pipeline.
## Prerequisites: Setup Instructions:
Apache Kafka installed and running.
Kafka Connect installed and configured.
Access to the CSV files to be ingested.
Basic understanding of Kafka and Kafka Connect concepts.

## Setup Instructions:
### Configure Kafka Connect: 
Ensure that Kafka Connect is properly configured and running. Verify the configuration files (connect-standalone properties and connector configuration files) to ensure they meet your requirements.

### Create Connector Configuration: 
Start Kafka Connect in standalone mode by running the following command:
#### bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties source-connector.properties

### Verify Data Ingestion:
 Monitor the Kafka Connect logs to ensure that the connector is successfully ingesting data from the CSV files and publishing it to the specified Kafka topic.
 
### Consumer Data from Kafka Topic: 
Use Kafka consumer applications or tools to consume data from the Kafka topic and perform further processing or analysis as needed.

## Additional Notes:
Customize the pipeline configurations and settings based on your specific requirements and environment.
Ensure that proper error handling and data validation mechanisms are implemented to handle edge cases and ensure data integrity.
Monitor system resources and performance metrics to optimize the pipeline's performance and scalability.
